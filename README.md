# Restaurant Reviews

As part of the FEND scholarship by Udacity and Google, for this project I've been provided with a restaurant website which wasn't properly configurated. For this project I had to update the site to match all types of viewports using responsive design (mobile, tablets, large screens), implement a11y (ARIA) features and most important, implement a map of all the available restaurants, also, I've deployed a Service Worker service to cache the content so the page can still be visited while offline.

## Installing from Github locally

1. Clone the following using GIT
   
	-git clone https://github.com/theclavedj/thecoolrestaurant.git

2. Load index.html in your favorite browser.

3. Explore the update website in all kind of viewports.


## Accessing Online:

To access updated website you can click in the following link to check the site: 

https://theclavedj.github.io/thecoolrestaurant/

## FAQ:

- Use tab to see a11y shortcuts around the page and explore only critical parts of the website are being selected.

- Use accessibility features such as VoiceOver to get description of each critical part of the website

- Use dev tools to check how the website has been improved to match diferent types of viewports

## Tools Used: 

Vanilla JavaScript, ES6, ARIA, CSS for responsive design, HTML5, Leaflet, Mapbox, Service Worker.
